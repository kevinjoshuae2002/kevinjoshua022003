Technologies Used

  1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):
     HTML is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It provides a set of elements (tags) that define the various parts 
     of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms. HTML documents are interpreted by web browsers to render the visual layout and content 
     of websites.

  2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
     CSS is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It allows web developers to define styles, such as colors, fonts, 
     spacing, and positioning, to enhance the visual appearance and consistency of web pages across different devices and screen sizes. CSS can be applied inline 
      within HTML elements, embedded within HTML documents, or linked externally as separate files.

  3. JavaScript:
   JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used to create dynamic and interactive elements on web pages. It enables developers to manipulate HTML 
   content, respond to user interactions, and dynamically update page elements without requiring a page reload. JavaScript is essential for implementing features 
   such as form validation, client-side data processing, animations, and AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) for fetching data from servers asynchronously.

Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the foundation of modern web development, allowing developers to create rich, engaging, and responsive user experiences on the web.
